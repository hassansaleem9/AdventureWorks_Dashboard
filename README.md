It includes a relational data model designed to store and organize large datasets, along with calculated fields created using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to provide advanced calculations and analytics. The project's main goal is to enable users to interactively explore and analyze data using interactive Power BI reports. Users can filter, sort, and drill down into data to uncover insights and make informed business decisions

# Features
This project is designed to manage clothing inventory and sales data. It includes three main categories with multiple subcategories for each. Users can view detailed information about each category, subcategory, product name, and brand. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of total orders, revenue, returns, and return rates.
Users can search for products based on location and use forecasting tools to predict future sales and customer interests. This helps to ensure that inventory is managed effectively and that popular products are stocked in the right quantities.
The clothing inventory project is useful for businesses of all sizes, including small boutiques and large retailers. It provides an easy-to-use interface for managing inventory, tracking sales data, and making data-driven decisions. By providing detailed information about products, sales, and customer behavior, the dashboard helps businesses optimize their inventory, increase sales, and improve customer satisfaction.
